## Urbyke APP

This is a prototype application for a test project at *Skylab Coders Academy* to apply the concept learn about *AngularJs*. The Web aplication is call **Urbyke App** and it's use to locate the public bike service all around the city of Barcelona, Spain. The repo contains all the templates and controllers that will help you through the review of the code; also shows the use of routes and factories that were use to make AJAX requests to collect all the data information.

### Getting Started

This is a set of directives and services for AngularJS `1.6.1`

### Dependencies

The following dependencies where use to make the Web application

- `AngularJS 1.6.1`

- `AngularJS route 1.6.1`

- `Bootstrap`

- `ngMap | AngularJS directives for google maps`

##### Google Maps API
To run the map from google you need to request an API key in the next link: [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/), then you need to add it into the your index.html file in a script tag.
(Reference line 29 from index.html you add **?key=<%GOOGLE-API%>**, where you need to replace **_<%GOOGLE-API%>_** with your Api-key )


### Running the example

You should launch at least a local server to make test of the application.
If you haven't installed Node yet, download the latest stable release of NodeJS from https://nodejs.org and install using all the default options.

Install the http-server globally on your machine using the node package manager (npm) command line tool, this will allow you to run a web server from anywhere on your computer.

Open a command prompt / command line window and enter the following:

`npm install -g http-server`
